# Putty

Your own Library of Congress.

## The Problem

I want my nonfiction books organized according to some widely-accepted classification system like the [Dewey Decimal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) or the [Library of Congress Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification), but defacing my precious books with tasteless spine labels is a non-starter.

## The Solution

These days, most books come with a label already printed on the back: the [International Standard Book Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN), or ISBN. Wikiepedia gives the confidence-inspiring assurance that these numbers are "intended to be unique", so we should be able to build a system that matches a book's ISBN to its classification and tells us where to shelve it.

## The Name

This project was originally called Dewey, after the famous librarian and classification system. A quick skim of [his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvil_Dewey) reveals that he's not the kind of guy one should name things after. So instead I'm calling it Putty, after [Herbert Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Putnam), the longest-serving Librarian of Congress who is remembered for his "impenetrable dignity" and "covered shyness".
