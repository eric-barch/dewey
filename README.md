# Dewey

An inventory manager for your personal library.

## Problem

Does this sound like you? You want your nonfiction books organized by topic according to the tried and true [Dewey Decimal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification), but you don't want to deface your precious books with hideous, damaging spine labels. No? Doesn't sound like you? Just my own weird neuroticism? Well, you're here, so why don't you just keep reading.

## Solution

We don't need more labels. Books already have a built in identifier: their ISBN barcode. With Dewey, you scan the barcode of the book you want to shelve, and it tells you where that book should go in relation to the books that are already on your shelf.
